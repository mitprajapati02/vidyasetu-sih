## Vidyasetu

Vidyasetu is an AI-based student dropout prediction and counseling platform that consolidates scattered academic data—attendance, marks, and fee records—into a single, actionable dashboard. Using rule-based thresholds combined with AI/ML insights, it helps institutions identify at-risk students early and enables timely, data-driven interventions without replacing human judgment.

## Project Status
This project is currently in development.
Core features such as data upload, rule-based risk classification, color-coded dashboards, mentor alerts, and report exports are implemented. Advanced AI/ML-based predictions using institution-specific historical success data and extended analytics are in progress.

## Project Context

  - This project was developed as an innovation-driven solution for a national-level problem statement (SIH), focusing on reducing student dropout rates through early detection and timely counseling.

## What We Set Out to Build
  
  - We aimed to build a simple, affordable, and scalable system that:
    Merges existing student data from multiple sources  
    Identifies at-risk students early
    Notifies mentors and parents in time
    Empowers educators rather than replacing them
    
  ## Why This Project Was Challenging (and Valuable)
  
  - Handling scattered and inconsistent data formats from different institutions
  - Designing a human-in-the-loop system where AI supports—not overrides—educators
  - Ensuring the system remains transparent, configurable, and easy to use
  - Balancing rule-based logic with AI/ML predictions for better accuracy
  
  ## Tools & Technologies Used
  - Vite + React (TypeScript) – Fast development and scalable frontend architecture
  - Tailwind CSS – Responsive, clean, and modern UI
  - AI/ML (Planned & In Progress) – Learning from institution-specific success stories
  - Rule-Based Logic – Transparent and configurable risk thresholds
  - Excel/CSV Handling – Seamless migration from existing systems
  - PDF & Excel Export – Institutional reporting and record-keeping
